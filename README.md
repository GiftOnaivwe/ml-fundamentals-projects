ML Fundamentals Projects

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that demonstrate core concepts in regression, classification, decision trees, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and probability distributions. Each notebook applies classical ML algorithms to real-world datasets, focusing on statistical modeling, model evaluation, and clear data storytelling.

These projects highlight strong foundations in statistics, supervised/unsupervised learning, and visualization â€” skills relevant for data-driven roles in analytics, AI/ML engineering, and applied research.

ðŸ“‚ Project List

1 **Decision Tree â€“ Diabetes Dataset**<br />
  - Built a decision tree classifier to predict diabetes likelihood.<br />
  - Evaluated model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2 **Logistic Regression â€“ Breast Cancer Dataset**<br />
  - Implemented binary classification with logistic regression.<br />
  - Achieved ~90% accuracy and validated with ROC-AUC analysis.
3 **Multiclass Logistic Regression â€“ Iris Dataset**<br />
  - Trained and evaluated multiclass logistic regression for species prediction.<br />
  - Applied softmax outputs and cross-entropy loss.
4 **Linear & Multilinear Regression â€“ Boston Housing & Synthetic Data**<br />
  - Predicted housing prices with RÂ² > 0.80.<br />
  - Conducted residual analysis to assess model assumptions.
5 **Probability Distributions & Hypothesis Testing**<br />
  - Explored normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions.<br />
  - Performed hypothesis testing to validate dataset patterns.
5 **TBP Analysis**<br />
  - Applied statistical inference and regression analysis to structured datasets.<br />
