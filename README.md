ML Fundamentals Projects

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that demonstrate core concepts in regression, classification, decision trees, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and probability distributions. Each notebook applies classical ML algorithms to real-world datasets, focusing on statistical modeling, model evaluation, and clear data storytelling.

These projects highlight strong foundations in statistics, supervised/unsupervised learning, and visualization â€” skills relevant for data-driven roles in analytics, AI/ML engineering, and applied research.

ðŸ“‚ Project List

1. **Decision Tree â€“ Diabetes Dataset**<br />
      - Built a decision tree classifier to predict diabetes likelihood.
      - Evaluated model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. **Logistic Regression â€“ Breast Cancer Dataset**<br />
      - Implemented binary classification with logistic regression.
      - Achieved ~90% accuracy and validated with ROC-AUC analysis.
3. **Multiclass Logistic Regression â€“ Iris Dataset**<br />
      - Trained and evaluated multiclass logistic regression for species prediction.
      - Applied softmax outputs and cross-entropy loss.
4. **Linear & Multilinear Regression â€“ Boston Housing & Synthetic Data**<br />
      - Predicted housing prices with RÂ² > 0.80.
      - Conducted residual analysis to assess model assumptions.
5. **Probability Distributions & Hypothesis Testing**<br />
      - Explored normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions.
      - Performed hypothesis testing to validate dataset patterns.
5. **TBP Analysis**<br />
      - Applied statistical inference and regression analysis to structured datasets.

ðŸ“Š Results

Achieved 85â€“92% accuracy on classification tasks (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).<br />
Delivered interpretable regression models with strong predictive power (Boston Housing RÂ² > 0.80).<br />
Produced visual insights that communicated statistical patterns clearly.<br />

<br />
ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Add clustering methods (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering). (on-going work)<br />
Extend to time-series forecasting datasets (attrition, workforce trends).<br />
Deploy models via Flask/FastAPI for interactive dashboards.<br />
Integrate Power BI / Tableau visualizations for business-oriented insights. (on-going work)<br />
